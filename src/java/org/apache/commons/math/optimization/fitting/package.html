This package provides classes to perform curve fitting.

<p>Curve fitting is a special case of an {@link
org.spaceroots.mantissa.estimation.EstimationProblem estimation problem}
were the parameters are the coefficients of a function <code>f</code>
whose graph <code>y=f(x)</code> should pass through sample points, and
were the measurements are the ordinates of the curve
<code>yi=f(xi)</code>.</p>

<p>The organisation of this package is explained in the class diagram
below. The {@link org.spaceroots.mantissa.fitting.AbstractCurveFitter
AbstractCurveFitter} class is the base class for all curve fitting
classes, it handles all common features like sample points
handling. Each specific curve fitting class should sub-class this
abstract class and implement the {@link
org.spaceroots.mantissa.fitting.AbstractCurveFitter#valueAt valueAt} and
{@link org.spaceroots.mantissa.fitting.AbstractCurveFitter#partial
partial} methods.</p>
