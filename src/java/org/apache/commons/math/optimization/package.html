This package provides common interfaces for the optimization algorithms
provided in sub-packages. The main interfaces are {@link
org.apache.commons.math.optimization.ObjectiveFunction ObjectiveFunction}
and {@link org.apache.commons.math.optimization.MultiObjectiveFunction
MultiObjectiveFunction}. Both interfaces are intended to be implemented by
user code to represent the problem they want to optimize.
</p>
<p>
The {@link org.apache.commons.math.optimization.ObjectiveFunction ObjectiveFunction}
interface represent a scalar function that should be either minimized or maximized,
by changing its input variables set until an optimal set is found. This function is
often called a cost function when the goal is to minimize it.
</p>

<p>
The {@link org.apache.commons.math.optimization.MultiObjectiveFunction
MultiObjectiveFunction} interface represent a vectorial function that should be either
minimized or maximized, by changing its input variables set until an optimal set is
found.
</p>

<p>
The {@link org.apache.commons.math.optimization.LeastSquaresConverter
LeastSquaresConverter} class can be used to convert vectorial objective functions to
scalar objective functions when the goal is to minimize them. This class is mostly used
when the vectorial objective function represents residuals, i.e. differences between a
theoretical result computed from a variables set applied to a model and a reference.
Residuals are intended to be minimized in order to get the variables set that best fit
the model to the reference. The reference may be obtained for example from physical
measurements whether the model is built from theoretical considerations.
