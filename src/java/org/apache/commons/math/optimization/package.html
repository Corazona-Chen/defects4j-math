This package provides common interfaces for the optimization algorithms
provided in sub-packages. The main interfaces are {@link
org.apache.commons.math.optimization.ObjectiveFunction ObjectiveFunction}
and {@link org.apache.commons.math.optimization.MultiObjectiveFunction
MultiObjectiveFunction}. Both interfaces are intended to be implemented by
user code to represent the problem they want to optimize.
</p>
<p>
The {@link org.apache.commons.math.optimization.ObjectiveFunction ObjectiveFunction}
interface represent a scalar function that should be either minimized or maximized,
by changing its input variables set until an optimal set is found. This function is
often called a cost function when the goal is to minimize it.
</p>

<p>
The {@link org.apache.commons.math.optimization.MultiObjectiveFunction
MultiObjectiveFunction} interface represent a vectorial function that should be either
minimized or maximized, by changing its input variables set until an optimal set is
found.
</p>

<p>
The {@link org.apache.commons.math.optimization.LeastSquaresConverter
LeastSquaresConverter} class can be used to convert vectorial objective functions to
scalar objective functions when the goal is to minimize them. This class is mostly used
when the vectorial objective function represents theoretical results computed from a
variables set applied to a model that should be fit against observations. Subtracting the
observations from the theoretical results give residuals. Residuals are intended to be
minimized in order to get the variables set that best fit the model to the observations.
The observations may be obtained for example from physical measurements whether the model
is built from theoretical considerations.
</p>

<p>
The {@link org.apache.commons.math.optimization.Optimizer Optimizer} interface represents
the optimization algorithm by itself. Several implementations of this interface are
available for different kind of problems. There is also one special implementations, the
{@link org.apache.commons.math.optimization.MultiStartOptimizer MultiStartOptimizer} which
wraps a classical optimizer to use it several times in row with different starting points
in order to avoid being trapped into a local extremum when looking for a global one.
