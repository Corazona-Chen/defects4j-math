<p>
This package provides classes to solve Ordinary Differential Equations problems
and compute derivatives of the solution.
</p>

<p>
This package solves Initial Value Problems of the form
<code>y'=f(t,y,p)</code> with <code>t<sub>0</sub></code>,
<code>y(t<sub>0</sub>)=y<sub>0</sub></code> and
<code>dy(t<sub>0</sub>)/dp</sub></code> known. The provided
integrator computes estimates of <code>y(t)</code>,
<code>dy(t)/dy<sub>0</sub></code> and <code>dy(t)/dp</code>
from <code>t=t<sub>0</sub></code> to <code>t=t<sub>1</sub></code>,
where <code>y</code> is the state and <code>p</code> is a parameters
array.
