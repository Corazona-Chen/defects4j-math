          The optimization package provides algorithms to optimize (i.e. minimize) some
          objective or cost function. The package is split in several sub-packages
          dedicated to different kind of functions or algorithms.
          <ul>
            <li>the univariate package handles univariate real functions,</li>
            <li>the linear package handles multivariate vector linear functions
                with linear constraints,</li>
            <li>the direct package handles multivariate real functions using direct
            search methods (i.e. not using derivatives),</li>
            <li>the general package handles multivariate real or vector functions
            using derivatives.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

      <subsection name="13.2 Univariate Functions" href="univariate">
        <p>
          A <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/analysis/minimization/UnivariateRealMinimizer.html">
          org.apache.commons.math.optimization.univariate.UnivariateRealMinimizer</a>
          is used to find the minimal values of a univariate real-valued function <code>f</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Minimization algorithms usage is very similar to root-finding algorithms usage explained
          in the analysis package. The main difference is that the <code>solve</code> methods in root
          finding algorithms is replaced by <code>minimize</code> methods.

      <subsection name="13.4 Direct Methods" href="direct">
        <p>
          Direct search methods only use cost function values, they don't
          need derivatives and don't either try to compute approximation of
          the derivatives. According to a 1996 paper by Margaret H. Wright
          (<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/doc/96/4-02.ps.gz">Direct
          Search Methods: Once Scorned, Now Respectable</a>), they are used
          when either the computation of the derivative is impossible (noisy
          functions, unpredictable discontinuities) or difficult (complexity,
          computation cost). In the first cases, rather than an optimum, a
          <em>not too bad</em> point is desired. In the latter cases, an
          optimum is desired but cannot be reasonably found. In all cases
          direct search methods can be useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simplex-based direct search methods are based on comparison of
          the cost function values at the vertices of a simplex (which is a
          set of n+1 points in dimension n) that is updated by the algorithms
          steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          The instances can be built either in single-start or in
          multi-start mode. Multi-start is a traditional way to try to avoid
          being trapped in a local minimum and miss the global minimum of a
          function. It can also be used to verify the convergence of an
          algorithm. In multi-start mode, the <code>minimizes</code>method
          returns the best minimum found after all starts, and the <code>etMinima</code>
          method can be used to retrieve all minima from all starts (including the one
          already provided by the <code>minimizes</code> method).
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code>direct</code> package provides two solvers. The first one is the classical
          <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/optimization/direct/NelderMead.html">
          Nelder-Mead</a> method. The second one is Virginia Torczon's
          <a href="../apidocs/org/apache/commons/math/optimization/direct/MultiDirectional.html">
          multi-directional</a> method.
