<section name="Commons-Math: The Jakarta Mathematics Library" href="summary">
        <p>
The Java programming language and the math extensions in commons-lang provide 
implementations for only the most basic mathematical algorithms. Routine development 
tasks such as computing basic statistics or solving a system of linear equations require 
components not available in java or commons-lang.
    </p>
        <p>
Most basic mathematical or statistical algorithms are available in open source 
implementations, but to assemble a simple set of capabilities one has to use multiple 
libraries, many of which have more restrictive licensing terms than the ASF. In addition, 
many of the best open source implementations (e.g. the R statistical package) are either 
not available in Java or require large support libraries and/or external dependencies to work.
    </p>


        <p>
Commons-Math is a library of lightweight, self-contained mathematics and statistics 
components addressing the most common practical problems not immediately available in the 
Java programming language or commons-lang. The guiding principles for commons-math are:

<ol>
<li>Real-world application use cases determine priority</li>
<li>Emphasis on small, easily integrated components rather than large libraries with 
complex dependencies</li>
<li>All algorithms are fully documented and follow generally accepted best practices</li>
<li>In situations where multiple standard algorithms exist, use the Strategy pattern to 
support multiple implementations</li>
<li>Limited dependencies. No external dependencies beyond Commons components and the JDK</li>
</ol>
</p>

Yes - I know that it should be commons-maths. But think of all the bandwidth saved by losing that 's' ;)

There haven't been any yet! The more people who contribute, the quicker this will happen.

    <p>
        Nightly builds are built once a day from the current CVS HEAD.
        This is (nearly) the lastest code and so should be treated with caution!
    </p>

        You can get the nightly builds from
